Installation
============

.. tip::
        To check which version of Bmesh you are using:
        - ``edit > preferences > addons`` and looking for the addon in the list by typing ``Bmesh Clean`` in the search bar



Download the files
---------------------

.. Note:: **For Mac users:** it often happens that Safari Browser is set to decompress .zip files, make sure this does not happen,
          otherwise the .zip file will no longer be a .zip file and you will not be able to install the addon as follows.

          Just go to the Safari menu bar at the top left and click on Safari>Preferences, then remove the check mark from
          "Open safe files after download" in the "General" window. Done, if in the future you download zipped files with safari,
          they will no longer be unzipped.


In your product page, you can find various files, the main ones for the installation are the following:

- ``bmesh_clean_v1_1_200.zip`` is the addon for blender, this is the addon that you need to install in Blender (The version number may change)
