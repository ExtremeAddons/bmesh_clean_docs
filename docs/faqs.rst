Are updates free?
***********************

Bmesh Clean was born in 2019 and since then all users who have purchased the addon have received all updates for free.
This means that if you buy the addon today, you will have access to all future updates.

So, Yes!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


From which version of Blender does Bmesh Clean work?
-----------------------------------------------------

From the version of Bmesh Clean 1.1.200 the addon will work from Blender 2.8 onwards, usually our addons are always
updated to more recent versions of Blender, with this rule:

The version of the addon is checked when the Beta version of Blender starts, but it is not recommended to use such Beta
versions of Blender, in favor of the officially released versions.

Does the addon work with Blender 4.2?
***************************************

.. important::
        From Blender 4.2 the addons are "Extensions" take a look here at the official page: https://code.blender.org/2024/05/extensions-platform-beta-release/

|

Yes, all my addons are ready for Blender 4.2 and the new Extension system.

Make sure you have installed the latest version of it, you can find here the list of updates: :ref:`updates_log`

You will be able to install the addon with the new Blender system. To do this, I recommend uninstalling the version you have
already installed, because it could be in the list of "Legacy" Addons, which means 2 things, either you have moved
the addon manually to the addons folder (Until Blender 4.1 this was not a problem)

So make sure to:

- Uninstall the addon (If you had it installed)
- Download the new version of the addon (If you haven't already downloaded it)
- Install the new version of the addon in Blender 4.2
